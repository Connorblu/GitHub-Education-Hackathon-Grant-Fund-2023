## Event Summary

- What made your hackathon special or unique? <br>
- This year we partnered with Code Black, a non-profit student organization working to promote diversity in Computer Science. With this collaboration,
we hosted a special track in our competition that aimed to preserve black culture, and we were able to expand the size of the audience that Code Black's hackathon
had last year. A diverse group of students were encouraged to tackle problems relating to diversity in software and teach others about Black Culture. 
- Tell us about some of the cool features, mini-events, or workshops that your organizers put on. <br>
- We had 4 workshops: Collaboration/Professional Networking Talk with Cisco, Research/AI Talk with Microsoft, UI/UX Workshop with Google, and AI/Machine Learning Workshop with Google.
There was also a Career Panel with all of our Sponsors and Partners where participants got to ask questions about a career in Computer Science.
- How was **GitHub** featured at your event? <br>
- All participants submitted their projects using GitHub, and we encouraged our mentors to teach beginner hackers on how to use GitHub during our Saturday mentoring session.
- *We’d love to see pictures if you have them!* <br>
